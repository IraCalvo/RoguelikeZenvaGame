# RoguelikeZenvaGame
Class Game

Considering that Rougelites and Rougelikes are my favorite games, this game was absolutely really fun to make and gave me alot of insight to how the games work.
This functions similar to Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, where the enemies only move when the player moves and is tile based. This game features:
-Automatic room generation
-Seeding and a seed inputter so you can play specific seeds
-A Minimap to display how the world was generated
-A feature that makes it so that the key spawns in the furthest room from the door 
-Unity Event system, where it listens to when the player moves or attacks so that it can make the enemies do something based on what happened.

Something important that this class taught me was that getting seeds for random generations of games. The most important thing I learned however was Unity Event system.
I learned how versatile the Events systems are and how strong it can be. This was my first time being introduced to it and using it.
